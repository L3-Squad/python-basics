# String Type Example

## What is the maximum value that can be stored inside a Python string variable?

### Below is the Max size

Max size: 8.00 TB

#### Single line using single quote

Single quote is same as double quote for string data type

#### Single line using double quote

Single quote is same as double quote for string data type

#### Multi line using single quote

Multi line statement can be
created using 3 single quotes.

#### Multi line using double quote

Multi line statement can be

greet = 'welcome';

## Slicing Example

### Accessing one specific character in string variable

#### Find the 3rd character from 0th index

c

#### Number after colon executed with `-1` which will be considered as start:stop

#### Accessing 3rd to 5th specific character in the string variable

Find the characters from 0th index to 5th index

com

#### Accessing from 0 to 5th specific character in the string variable

Find the characters from 0th index to 5th index

welcom

#### Accessing from 3rd to end of the string variable

Find the characters from 0th index to last index

come

#### Accessing from last to 4 characters in the string variable

Find the characters from last index to 4 characters

come

#### Accessing from last to 4 characters but skip last character in the string variable

Find the characters from last index to 4 characters with skipping last character

come

## Iteration Example

#### Iterate the Greet String and print each character

character: w  
character: e  
character: l  
character: c  
character: o  
character: m  
character: e

## Find Length Example

#### Find a Length of greet String

greet length 7

## `in / not in` Exist Check Example

#### Find whether `w` string exists in greet variable using `in` keyword

Time Complexity: O(n). In Python, strings are typically implemented as arrays of characters. The operation 'w' in greet is essentially a search operation where Python checks each character in the string greet to see if it matches 'w'.

True

#### Use `in` statement in `if` statement as well

w exists in greet variable

#### Use `in` statement in `if` statement as well

u Not exist in greet variable

## Format Example

#### format() method takes an unlimited number of arguments. Example

I am currently Full Stack engineer at Meta Inc and working in Singapore.

#### format() with index numbers

hey i work for Meta Inc in Singapore as Full Stack engineer

#### format() with missing index numbers, meaning not giving all the index

#### Error: cannot switch from manual field specification to automatic field numbering
